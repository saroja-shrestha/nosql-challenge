# nosql-challenge

I did this challenge on my own with the help of provided materials. I created database as 'uk_food' and collection as 'establishments'. After that, I imported the json file through terminal. 


I inserted one file name 'new' in the collection. After inserting new data, I did many updates, findings, count and delete. Also, I changed the data types. I also converted the result to a Pandas DataFrame.
